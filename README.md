Responsive_Portfolio

Using html, CSS, and Bootstrap, I have created a responsive portfolio. When the window or screen size changes, the design is responsive and changes as well.

I have included a Navbar with my name, About, Portfolio, and Contact. If you click on my name from any page, it will redirect to the About page. When the window or screen size changes on the Portfolio page, the images are responsive.

There is a fixed footer at the bottom of each page that is also responsive to window and screen size.
